# Introduction

On the previous chapter, we configured a CI workflow using Argo Workflows and built an image.  
But, workflow still needs to be fired manually.

Now, let's detect events using the Argo Events and trigger workflow automatically.

In this chapter, we'll try to:

- Deploy Argo Events
- Trigger workflows through events
- Connect Argo Events for complete CI pipeline
