# Introduction

On the previous chapter, we combined Argo Events and Argo Workflows to configure a complete CI pipeline.  
Now, we will configure a CD pipeline through Argo CD and connect it with the CI workflow.

In this chapter, we'll try to:

- Deploy Argo CD
- Control basic resource with Argo CD, workflow as an example
- Connect Argo CD to complete the CI/CD pipeline
