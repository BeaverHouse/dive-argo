# Introduction

In the first chapter, we will set up minimum K8S environment with simple process and deploy Argo Workflows, a part of Argo Project, with Helm chart.

We'll need extra procedure to make more stable testing environment, but we'll do it later for now. Let's try to deploy Argo as simple & fast as possible, to check it out with our own eyes!
