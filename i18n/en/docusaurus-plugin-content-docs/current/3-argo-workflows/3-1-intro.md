# Introduction

On the previous chapter, we advanced our K8S environment and successfully logged into Argo Workflows.  
Now let's get down to experience Argo Workflows.

In this chapter, we'll try to:

- Create and execute basic workflow
- Take a look at frequently used workflow types and experience them
- Implement CI workflow to build/push container image

Most of the content are based on [Argo Workflows official docs][docs] and examples.
