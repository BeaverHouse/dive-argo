# Getting Started

Nowadays, Kubernetes(K8S) becomes main stream globally and numerous projects are being launched and progressing from it. DevOps concepts are already settling down fast starting with big companies. However, it's still quite hard to search for references related to K8S and DevOps in South Korea. Although official docs are well-made and some developers are posting their knowledges, I think it's not following it's demand currently.

But there's also many helpful documents too. When started to learn Elasticsearch I got a help from [Elastic Guidebook][esbook], and I really impressed by [MLOps for ALL][mlops], although I didn't know much about MLOps. I thought that it can be helpful for both me and someone else if I summarize and store knowledge, so I decided to make documentations as I started to learn Argo.

I'm a junior developer now, and I may have weakness on some theoretical concepts. So I tried to make _Dive to Argo_ mainly with real practice in my way. I know that it cannot satisfy everyone, but I'll feel rewarded if someone got help or insight with K8S or Argo, with this documentation.

**I'm always open with errors or feedbacks, and also you can contribute to some translation issues because I'm not native English user.**  
So let's start _Dive to Argo_.

<br />

:::caution Before Start

- Understanding with Kubernetes is required.  
  You should be able to read/write some `yaml` files and understand basic components of K8S.
- It's recommended to know Helm's basic concept and commands, and have ability to understand Helm charts.
- Also you need some other basic skills: Linux commands, basic shell scripts, basic coding ability... and so on.
